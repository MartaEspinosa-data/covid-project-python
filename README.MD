# COVID-19 Project
This project explores how the number of vaccinations and deaths due to COVID-19 have evolved over time in different countries. The data used in this project was obtained from the "Our World in Data" website and contains information about COVID-19 vaccinations and deaths in different countries from January 2020 to September 2021.

## Tools Used
This project was completed using Python programming language and the pandas library for data analysis. The code and analysis can be found in the main.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
Before analyzing the data, it was cleaned and prepared by removing any missing or duplicate values and ensuring consistency across all fields. The data was then grouped by country and year to calculate the total number of vaccinations and deaths in each country for each year.

## Data Analysis
The analysis was conducted by creating visualizations and tables to explore the trends and patterns in the data. The project includes various charts, such as bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots, to visualize the evolution of the number of vaccinations and deaths in different countries over time.

## Results and Findings
The project revealed that some countries were able to vaccinate a larger percentage of their population, while others lagged behind. The number of deaths due to COVID-19 also varied greatly among different countries.
